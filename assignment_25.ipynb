    "Generators and iterators are closely related concepts in Python, as generators are a type of iterator. \n",

    "- Both map calls and list comprehensions can be used to transform an iterable by applying a function or expression to each element.\n",

    "- List comprehensions are more readable and intuitive for simple transformations and can include conditional statements for filtering elements or adding additional logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrast:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Map calls return an iterator, while list comprehensions return a new list directly.\n",
    "- Map calls can operate on any iterable, whereas list comprehensions work specifically with lists or other iterable sequences.\n",
    "- List comprehensions allow for more flexibility by supporting conditional statements and multiple expressions, making it possible to filter and transform elements simultaneously.\n",
    "- Map calls may be more efficient for large datasets or when you need to process elements lazily, as they return an iterator that computes values on demand."
